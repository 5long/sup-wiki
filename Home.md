# Sup

Sup is an email client written in Ruby originally by William Morgan.

(This wiki is a replacement for the [original sup wiki](http://sup.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl) - sadly that wiki has not been maintained and has been massively vandalised. That wiki also appears to drop history after 10 revisions, so much content appears to be permanently lost.)

tutorial for new users how to import mails from their sources
(tagging what's outbox and what's inbox and that I already read my
40000 mails) without having to do every single thing (selecting
mail, hitting return and x to mark everything as read for instance)
by hand would be really, really, really, really awesome.

Address Book / Contact List surfing
(A description of the formats and possible directives of each
config file would be super handy)

"I'm nuts/interested and want to know how Sup does its searching/tagging thing"
