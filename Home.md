### Importing mail from sources
Tutorial for new users how to import mails from their sources
(tagging what's outbox and what's inbox and that I already read my
40000 mails) without having to do every single thing (selecting
mail, hitting return and x to mark everything as read for instance)
by hand would be really, really, really, really awesome.

### Address Book / Contact List surfing
(A description of the formats and possible directives of each
config file would be super handy)

### Internal workings
"I'm nuts/interested and want to know how Sup does its searching/tagging thing"
